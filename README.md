# Hostelverse

We have created an awesome app to tackle the problems related to hostels. Tighten your seat belt to go into a fascinating journey.

The main motto of the project is to provide easy accessibility for students and other related authorities to handle hostel management services.
Some of the main tasks are :

- Hostel listing
- Hostel allotment
- Resolving issues related to alloted rooms
- Keeping an eye on the attendance of enrolled students
- Broadcasting the Announcements
- Updating your profiles
- Applying for leave
  many more

There are three main modules which includes student, warden and admin.

Student module focus on the issues which are faced by students like checkin and checkout, reporting a complaint, giving feedback for improvement.

Warden module focus on the issues which are faced by warden like keeping an eye on attendance off students, getting a list of all the issues faced by enrolled students along with power to solve them, approving for leave application of students, creating new announcements and getting feedbacks.
